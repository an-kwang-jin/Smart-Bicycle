A dot matrix(MAX7419) is located on the back of the bicycle. It shows signals such as left turn, right turn, etc. through the display.

A bicycle instrument panel(PCB Board) is located on the axis of the bicycle handle. The PCB Board consists of two led and mpu6050 gyrosensor and Arduino Nano.

The buttons are located on both handles of the bicycle handle so that the receiver can be displayed with the signal button.
